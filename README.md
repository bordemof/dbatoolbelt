===========

This is a collection of various scripts I use to administer dbs. This is an old collection and much of the documentation will live in the script itself. Not all of them have proper author attribution and that will be a work in progress.


The 3 main ones I use - whoisactive, brents takeover, and glenns diagnostic queries are pretty obvious. I will try
to keep them updated since they don't have their own formal projects in source control to pull from.
